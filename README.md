# MaoozOS Android

Android wrapper for MaoozOS 3.2.0.

## What is included

- The same offline MaoozOS web application bundled inside the APK.
- WebView DOM/local storage so records and settings persist on the Android app.
- External HTTP/HTTPS links open in the device browser.
- File picker support for MaoozOS backup import.
- Native Android full-backup export using the system Save dialog.
- Offline device-to-device migration: export one portable JSON backup and import it on another Android device.
- Backup export validates the MaoozOS container before opening the save dialog.
- Import failures leave the current local dataset unchanged.
- Native Android notification channel.
- Android 13+ `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission flow.
- Native notification settings shortcut.
- Optional exact-alarm settings for more precise class reminders.
- Native recurring timetable reminders that continue working when the WebView is not open.
- Reminder recovery after device reboot/app update.
- Quiet-hours handling for native class reminders.

## Build

Use Android Studio with a recent stable version. The project uses:

- Android Gradle Plugin 9.3.0
- Gradle 9.5.0
- Compile SDK 36
- Target SDK 36
- Minimum SDK 26
- Java 17

Open this folder as a project in Android Studio, let Gradle sync and install any missing Android SDK components, then use:

**Build → Generate App Bundles or APKs → Generate APKs → APK**

The debug APK will normally be produced under:

`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

For a release APK, configure your own signing key in Android Studio. Do not publish a debug-signed APK.

## Important data note

The Android WebView has its own local storage. It does not automatically inherit Chrome/Edge's MaoozOS data. Use MaoozOS's **Export Full Backup** on the web version, then use **Import Backup** inside Android to move your data.

## Notification behavior

Android 13 and newer requires the user to grant notification permission. The MaoozOS Settings page exposes Android-specific controls when the app is running inside this wrapper:

- Enable
- System settings
- Test
- Configure precise class reminders

The Android reminder layer currently schedules timetable class reminders. The web app's in-app notification engine remains available as well.

## Offline device migration

On the old Android device:

1. Open **Settings → Data & Backup → Export Full Backup**.
2. Save the `.json` backup somewhere you can transfer offline.
3. Transfer the file with USB, Quick Share, Bluetooth, SD card, or another offline method.

On the new Android device:

1. Open MaoozOS.
2. Choose **Settings → Data & Backup → Import Backup**.
3. Select the backup file.

The backup contains MaoozOS application data and configuration stored by the web app. Android-level permissions (such as notification permission) are controlled by Android and may need to be granted again on the new device. A failed or invalid import does not replace the current local data.
